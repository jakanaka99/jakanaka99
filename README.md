**Aspiring SOC Analyst | Blue Team Enthusiast | Cybersecurity Learner**

I'm building my foundation in **Security Operations** through hands-on investigations on **LetsDefend**, where I analyze alerts, study attack patterns, and learn how real SOC teams detect and respond to threats.  
This GitHub profile serves as my **learning journal**, documenting my progress across SOC fundamentals, incident response, phishing analysis, and log investigation.
