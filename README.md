**Aspiring SOC Analyst | Blue Team Learner | Cybersecurity Enthusiast**

I’m currently building my foundation in **Security Operations (SOC)** through hands-on labs on **LetsDefend** — where I investigate alerts, analyze incidents, and learn how real-world attacks are detected and contained.  
This GitHub is my **learning journal**, where I document my progress, notes, and practical exercises across SOC operations, threat detection, and log analysis.
